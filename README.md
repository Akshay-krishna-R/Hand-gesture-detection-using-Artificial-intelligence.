# Hand-gesture-detection-using-Artificial-intelligence.
First run  capturing_images_using_webcam.py code, so that by running this code dataset can be created with users webcam which can be used to train the model.
After creating the dataset run training_the_model.py code, which is used to train the model using the Deep learning technique.
After training the model run the front_end_for_recognition.py code, so that the program will execute and it will capture the gesture which is provided through the user's webcam and it will recognize the gesture which is provided by the user.
